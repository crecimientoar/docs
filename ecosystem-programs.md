# Ecosystem Programs

The **Crecimiento Foundation** goal is to grow the builder funnel by supporting hundreds of independent initiatives that, together, empower builders and startups, drive widespread crypto adoption, regulatory innovation, and economic transformation.&#x20;

These initiatives are called Ecosystem Programs and are led by proactive members of the movement who act autonomously and receive support from the foundation. Ecosystem programs tackle different stages of the Builder Funnel and can include things like media, hackathons, hacker houses, workshops, events, accelerators, etc.

## **A movement supporting an ecosystem to support people**

The Crecimiento Movement, Ecosystem, and Foundation work in a regenerative cycle where successful initiatives drive real-world impact, reinforcing the movement’s mission. As projects grow, they give back to the ecosystem through mentorship, funding, and new opportunities, fueling long-term, scalable growth that accelerates Argentina’s transformation into a global crypto hub. This continuous collaboration ensures that the expansion of the ecosystem strengthens the foundation and benefits the entire community.
