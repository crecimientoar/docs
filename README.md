# About Crecimiento

Crecimiento emerged from a simple yet powerful idea: it’s time to drive transformative crypto adoption across Argentina and redefine the country’s economic landscape. Argentina’s unique conditions, including high grassroots crypto adoption, world-class developer talent, strong political backing, and a wave of investor interest, have created an ideal environment to turn Argentina into a leading hub for crypto and tech innovation.

## Our Vision for Transformation

Our vision at Crecimiento is to ignite a crypto-powered transformation. We’re here to help build an ecosystem that:

* **Brings 5 to 10 million people on-chain** through impactful products and startups.
* **Amplifies Argentina’s tech ecosystem tenfold** with infrastructure, funding, and ongoing support.
* **Establishes long-term stability** for startups, offering over 20 years of regulatory continuity to foster sustainable growth.

### How We’re Bringing This Vision to Life

We’re bringing together dreamers, believers, and innovators to shape this vision. Season 1 laid a foundation with the **Aleph Pop-Up City in August**, a collaborative environment that sparked connections, projects, and new ideas. Aleph’s success—hosting 68 startups, engaging hundreds of builders, and attracting significant media attention—showed what’s possible when community and collaboration lead the way. Moving forward, we are leveraging these learnings to provide more defined structures for growth, such as:

* A **regulatory sandbox** in Buenos Aires to foster compliant innovation,
* New **growth and support frameworks** like startup accelerators, and
* Expanding **partnerships and collaboration** to empower Argentina’s builders.

With **3,000+ visionaries** already onboard, Crecimiento’s mission to drive Argentina’s crypto adoption is gathering momentum. Season 3, anchored by the **March's Pop-Up City**, represents the beginning of a new phase focused on scaling this impact. Are you in?
