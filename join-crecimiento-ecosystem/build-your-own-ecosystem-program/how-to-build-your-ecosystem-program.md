# How to build your Ecosystem Program

While anyone can create programs and initiatives that support Crecimiento’s vision, becoming a “recognized” Ecosystem Project requires going through a public approval process.

Individuals, teams, or partners with program ideas can submit their proposals through a dedicated channel in [**Crecimiento’s Discord**.](https://discord.gg/BnH7ACbDAj) This channel serves as a public space where community members can review, provide feedback, and engage with proposals in real-time.

### The proposal evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. **Submit the proposal on** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/BnH7ACbDAj)
2. **Get Community Feedback**: the proposal will be open to the community for feedback, suggestions, and discussions.
3. **Foundation Async Review and Questions**: the Foundation team will conduct an asynchronous review of the proposal and raise questions.
4. **15-Minute Call with the Ecosystem Team**: the proposal creators will join a 15-minute call with the Foundation’s team to clarify support needs, and further refine the program’s goals and structure.
5. **Final Review**: The Foundation team will conduct a final review to determine if the proposal can move forward as a recognized Ecosystem Program.

Note: Since the Foundation commits to supporting all recognized Ecosystem Programs with time and resources, some proposals may not receive official recognition. However, those proposals are still encouraged to keep working independently and may receive basic assistance, such as informal mentorship or networking support, wherever possible.
