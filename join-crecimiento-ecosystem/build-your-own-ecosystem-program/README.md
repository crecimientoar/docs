# Build your own Ecosystem Program

As Crecimiento begins Season 2, we’re launching our Ecosystem Programs—a platform for builders, contributors, and partners to bring impactful projects to life, focusing this season’s efforts on supporting the December Pop-Up City. Our goal is to channel the energy and creativity within the community into initiatives that showcase the movement’s potential to drive Argentina’s crypto adoption forward.

### What Are Ecosystem Programs?

Ecosystem Programs allow contributors and partners to develop and execute initiatives that benefit the broader community. For Season 2, our focus is exclusively on pop-up-related activities, including hackathons, educational workshops, and community-building projects. This initial focus will allow us to fine-tune processes, learn from real-world feedback, and create a foundation for broader program support in future seasons.

## What kind of support do Ecosystem Programs get?

### Operational Support

The Foundation provides logistical support, including access to working documents, exclusive sources of information, and regular follow-ups. Program creators benefit from real-time support from the ecosystem team and regular async feedback from the Foundation and highly-experienced individuals. This ensures smooth execution and alignment throughout the program’s lifecycle

### Mentorship and Guidance

Ecosystem Programs receive access to a network of experienced mentors from various fields, including crypto, tech, finance, and business. Program creators can tap into this expertise for ongoing advice, problem-solving, and strategic direction.

### Marketing and Promotion

The Foundation helps boost visibility for Ecosystem Programs through its established communication channels, including social media, newsletters, and its website. This ensures that programs gain attention within the community and among potential participants.

### Networking and Partnerships

Ecosystem Programs are connected to key partners, including companies, universities, and other organizations within the Crecimiento network. These connections help programs find collaborators, participants, and supporters to grow and scale.
