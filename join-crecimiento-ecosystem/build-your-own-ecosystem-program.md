# Build your own Ecosystem Program

Ecosystem Programs are self-driven initiatives designed to advance Crecimiento’s vision by supporting the crypto ecosystem’s growth in Argentina. These programs, launched by contributors, partners, and companies, work within the Crecimiento Foundation to drive innovation, empower builders and grow crypto adoption. They are a fundamental piece of making Crecimiento a strong and resilient movement, capable of achieving amazing things in very short time.

Anyone within the ecosystem—contributors, startups, institutions, or companies—can propose an Ecosystem Program. While these programs operate independently, they are supported by the Foundation with resources recognition, mentorship, and access to a network of collaborators. This ensures alignment with Crecimiento’s mission while giving program creators the freedom to innovate and lead their initiatives.

## How to build your Ecosystem Program

While anyone can create programs and initiatives that support Crecimiento’s vision, becoming a “recognized” Ecosystem Project requires going through a public approval process.

Individuals, teams, or partners with program ideas can submit their proposals through a dedicated channel in [**Crecimiento’s Discord**.](https://discord.gg/BnH7ACbDAj) This channel serves as a public space where community members can review, provide feedback, and engage with proposals in real-time.

[Template for Ecosystem Program Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FC9ziCZL5Fyl4uktbr02GQ6-i68OKSM2muFHljac3LI/edit)

### The proposal evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. **Submit the proposal on** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/BnH7ACbDAj)
2. **Get Community Feedback**: the proposal will be open to the community for feedback, suggestions, and discussions.
3. **Foundation Async Review and Questions**: the Foundation team will conduct an asynchronous review of the proposal and raise questions.
4. **15-Minute Call with the Ecosystem Team**: the proposal creators will join a 15-minute call with the Foundation’s team to clarify support needs, and further refine the program’s goals and structure.
5. **Final Review**: The Foundation team will conduct a final review to determine if the proposal can move forward as a recognized Ecosystem Program.

Note: Since the Foundation commits to supporting all recognized Ecosystem Programs with time and resources, some proposals may not receive official recognition. However, those proposals are still encouraged to keep working independently and may receive basic assistance, such as informal mentorship or networking support, wherever possible.

## What kind of support do Ecosystem Programs get?

### Operational Support

The Foundation provides logistical support, including access to working documents, exclusive sources of information, and regular follow-ups. Program creators benefit from real-time support from the ecosystem team and regular async feedback from the Foundation and highly-experienced individuals. This ensures smooth execution and alignment throughout the program’s lifecycle

### Mentorship and Guidance

Ecosystem Programs receive access to a network of experienced mentors from various fields, including crypto, tech, finance, and business. Program creators can tap into this expertise for ongoing advice, problem-solving, and strategic direction.

### Marketing and Promotion

The Foundation helps boost visibility for Ecosystem Programs through its established communication channels, including social media, newsletters, and its website. This ensures that programs gain attention within the community and among potential participants.

### Networking and Partnerships

Ecosystem Programs are connected to key partners, including companies, universities, and other organizations within the Crecimiento network. These connections help programs find collaborators, participants, and supporters to grow and scale.
