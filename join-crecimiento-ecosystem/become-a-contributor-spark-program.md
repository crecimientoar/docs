# Become a Contributor: Spark Program

The Spark Contributor Program is designed to engage individuals who want to get involved in Crecimiento and contribute to it's growing ecosystem. There are 3 different ways to contribute:

* Take a task from the Open Task Board
* Apply to the Public Talent Repository
* Contribute to existing Ecosystem Programs

### Open Task Board

The [**Open Task Board**](https://app.dework.xyz/crecimiento-28019) is fully open and accessible to all. Contributors can join through Dework, a platform integrated with Discord, where they can select tasks from a public board. These tasks are short-term and easy to complete, offering a low-barrier way to contribute to the movement. Contributors can demonstrate their abilities by completing tasks regularly and supporting the movement in a flexible way.

### Talent Repository

The [**Public Talent Repository**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbCbtVktjL42E7m4JDA3jWMiyEosmmI73Iem2blPGlx\_Sfaw/viewform) is a more structured option that requires contributors to apply by submitting their profiles through an application form. These profiles become part of a public database that can be accessed by the Foundation, companies, partners, and ecosystem programs. Contributors from this repository are brought in when there’s a specific need from the Foundation. This option focuses on filling key roles and providing specialized help for tasks that require deeper expertise and commitment.
