# Become a Contributor: Spark Program

The Spark Contributor Program is designed to engage individuals who want to get involved in Crecimiento and contribute to its growing ecosystem. It offers two different options for contributors, allowing for both short-term, task-based contributions and more specialized, long-term roles that directly support the Foundation and its initiatives.

The [**Public Task Board**](https://app.dework.xyz/crecimiento-28019) is fully open and accessible to all. Contributors can join through Dework, a platform integrated with Discord, where they can select tasks from a public board. These tasks are short-term and easy to complete, offering a low-barrier way to contribute to the movement. Contributors can demonstrate their abilities by completing tasks regularly and supporting the movement in a flexible way.

The **Public Talent Repository** is a more structured option that requires contributors to apply by submitting their profiles through an application form. These profiles become part of a public database that can be accessed by the Foundation, companies, partners, and ecosystem programs. Contributors from this repository are brought in when there’s a specific need from the Foundation. This option focuses on filling key roles and providing specialized help for tasks that require deeper expertise and commitment.
