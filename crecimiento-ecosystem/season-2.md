# Season 2

## **Season 2: October 14th - December 16th**

Crecimiento’s journey into Season 2 marks the beginning of an exciting new phase focused on impact, collaboration, and real-world activation. Running from **October 14th to December 16th**, this season is centered on scaling the movement’s momentum and setting the stage for what lies ahead in 2025. The **December Pop-Up City** event is the main driver of this season’s goals, providing a vibrant space for builders, startups, and partners to come together, test ideas, and build on Crecimiento’s mission.

### **Goals and Structure**

Season 2 will build on the foundation set by Season 1 and take a structured approach to growth, experimentation, and feedback. Each initiative and project contributes to the builder funnel and supports Crecimiento’s overarching goals:

1. **Empowering Builders and Programs**: Expanding the reach and depth of Crecimiento’s **Ecosystem Programs** by focusing on initiatives aligned with the December Pop-Up.
2. **Partner and Startup Engagement**: Engaging partners and startups to bring impactful opportunities to the ecosystem. We’ll work closely with them to ensure their presence, activities, and contributions are impactful and help strengthen the Argentine crypto landscape.
3. **Developing Key Projects**: Alongside the Pop-Up, major programs such as **City Tech, the Venture Studio, Accelerator, and Founder School** are being incubated, with further plans to launch in 2024.

### **How Seasons Drive Our Growth**

Seasons allow Crecimiento to test, adapt, and improve on a recurring basis. Season 2 will serve as an incubator for processes, programs, and new projects that align with our long-term vision. It’s a chance for the entire Crecimiento ecosystem to gather feedback, refine our support structures, and continue building toward a thriving crypto and tech ecosystem in Argentina.
