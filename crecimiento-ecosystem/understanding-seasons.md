# Understanding Seasons

Seasons are Crecimiento’s way of organizing initiatives, programs, and priorities into focused periods of growth, adaptation, and experimentation. Each season has a defined start and end date, giving the movement a framework to set specific goals, gather community input, and align our efforts around key events or milestones. Seasons not only keep us agile but also allow us to evolve our organizational structures to stay in tune with new challenges, feedback, and emerging opportunities in Argentina’s crypto landscape.

### **Why Seasons?**

Each season serves as a testing ground, helping us improve our processes, refine support mechanisms, and strengthen the community’s involvement in shaping Crecimiento. By structuring our work in seasons, we can:

* **Experiment with New Programs and Initiatives**: Seasons provide the flexibility to launch, test, and adjust programs, collecting valuable feedback from participants and partners.
* **Respond to Changing Needs**: A season’s timeframe allows us to remain responsive to shifts in the market, technology, and Argentina’s economic landscape.
* **Maintain Focus**: Each season has a set focus, ensuring that resources and attention are aligned with our goals, whether it’s growing the builder funnel, driving adoption, or securing partnerships.

### **How Seasons Work**

At the start of each season, we announce our primary objectives, highlight focus areas, and outline key programs. As the season progresses, the ecosystem works together to reach these goals, with opportunities for feedback, adjustment, and iteration. When the season concludes, we conduct retrospectives to gather insights and shape the focus for the next season.

Seasons are more than time-boxed phases; they are the engine of Crecimiento’s growth and impact, helping us adapt, improve, and bring Argentina closer to becoming a global crypto hub.
