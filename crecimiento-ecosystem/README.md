# Crecimiento Ecosystem

Crecimiento is not just a movement—it’s a growing ecosystem of builders, researchers, founders, investors, and dreamers testing, launching, and growing crypto solutions to solve Argentina's most pressing economic challenges.

## **The Builder Funnel**

The Builder Funnel is the backbone of Crecimiento's ecosystem, guiding projects from ideation to impact. Crecimiento's vision requires supporting each stage—idea, validation, product development, and scaling—through accelerators, incubators, and hackathons. The **Crecimiento Foundation** plays a critical role in this process, offering both **non-financial** and **financial** support to ecosystem projects, offering both resources and guidance to help initiatives grow and succeed.

## Powering the Builder Funnel: Ecosystem Programs

Our goal is simple: to support hundreds of independent initiatives that, together, drive widespread crypto adoption, regulatory innovation, and economic transformation. Crecimiento’s ecosystem is designed to empower startups, companies, institutions, and individual contributors to create and scale impactful products.

These initiatives are called Ecosystem Programs and be led by proactive members of the movement who act autonomously and receive support from the foundation. Ecosystem programs tackle different stages of the Builder Funnel and can include things like media, hackathons, hacker houses, workshops, events, accelerators, etc.

## **A movement supporting an ecosystem to support people**

The Crecimiento Movement, Ecosystem, and Foundation work in a regenerative cycle where successful initiatives drive real-world impact, reinforcing the movement’s mission. As projects grow, they give back to the ecosystem through mentorship, funding, and new opportunities, fueling long-term, scalable growth that accelerates Argentina’s transformation into a global crypto hub. This continuous collaboration ensures that the expansion of the ecosystem strengthens the foundation and benefits the entire community.
