### 2nd Stage - Evaluation Process

The proposal evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. Community Feedback: Once submitted, the proposal will be open to the community for feedback, suggestions, and discussions. This input helps refine the proposal and improve its chances of success.
2. Foundation Async Review and Questions: After community feedback, the Foundation team will conduct an asynchronous review of the proposal. They may ask follow-up questions or request additional information to ensure clarity and alignment with Crecimiento’s mission. This call will focus on addressing any remaining questions, clarifying support needs, and further refining the program’s goals and structure.
3. Final Review: The Foundation team will conduct a final review to determine if the proposal can move forward as a recognized Ecosystem Program.

Note: Since the Foundation commits to supporting all recognized Ecosystem Programs with time and resources, some proposals may not receive official recognition. However, those proposals are still encouraged to keep working independently and may receive basic assistance, such as informal mentorship or networking support, wherever possible.
