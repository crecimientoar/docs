# Crecimiento Support Program

Crecimiento Support Program (CSP) is designed to support Ecosystem Programs. Anyone within the ecosystem— community members, contributors, startups, institutions, or companies—can create an Ecosystem Program.

Through Crecimiento Support Program, program builders can get support by Crecimiento Foundation in the form of official recognition, mentorship, use of the cowork space and access to a network of collaborators. This ensures alignment with Crecimiento’s mission while giving program creators the freedom to innovate and lead their initiatives.

The process to get support is pretty straightforward:

* Go to [**Crecimiento's forum**](https://forum.crecimiento.build/)
* Submit your proposal
* Get approved and receive support!
